#Find Peak Element
'''
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Example:
    Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

class Solution:
    def findPeakElement(self,nums):
        l,r=0,len(nums)-1
        while l<r:
            m=(l+r)//2
            if nums[m]<nums[m+1]:
                l=m+1
            else:
                r=m
        return r
