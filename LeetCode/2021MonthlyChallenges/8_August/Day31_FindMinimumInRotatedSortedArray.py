#Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
'''
Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:
    [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
    [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].
Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Example:
    Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.

class Solution:
    def findMin(self,nums):
        l,r=0,len(nums)-1
        while l<r:
            m=(l+r)//2
            if nums[m]>nums[r]:
                l=m+1
            else:
                r=m
        return nums[l]
